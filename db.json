Unlike traditional object detection algorithms that require multiple passes over an image, YOLO processes the entire image in a single forward pass of a neural network, enabling it to detect objects quickly. YOLO divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell simultaneously. This approach makes YOLO well-suited for applications requiring real-time object detection, such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and augmented reality.

This approach allows WaveNet to capture detailed nuances of natural speech, resulting in high-quality and natural-sounding synthetic speech. WaveNet operates by autoregressively predicting the next sample in the waveform conditioned on previous samples, using dilated convolutional neural networks.
